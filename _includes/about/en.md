# GPTSecurity

## Introduction

Welcome to GPTSecurity! This is a knowledge base dedicated to the intelligent revolution in the field of future security!

GPTSecurity is a community that covers cutting-edge academic research and practical experience sharing. It integrates knowledge on the applications of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), AI-generated content (AIGC), and large language models (LLM) in the security domain. Here, you can find the latest research papers, blog articles, practical tools, and preset prompts related to GPT, AIGC, and LLM.

GPTSecurity not only focuses on current technologies and trends but also aspires to be a participant and promoter of the intelligent revolution in the future security domain. In this rapidly developing field, we need to work together, embrace change, and continue to evolve to better apply new technologies in security amidst the wave of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our goal is to provide a convenient collaboration platform for practitioners, researchers, and developers in the security field, allowing them to share experiences, exchange ideas, and explore new possibilities.

Join the GPTSecurity community and let us work together to create an intelligent future in the security field!

## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you very much for your attention and support for GPTSecurity! We eagerly look forward to your contributions to jointly build this knowledge base focused on the application of GPT, AIGC, and LLM in the security domain. Please refer to the following guidelines to ensure that your submissions are within the appropriate scope and better facilitate communication and discussion.

### 1. Choose the Appropriate Category

Before submitting a contribution, please ensure that your content fits one of the following categories:

- **Research Papers:** Collect and organize the latest research papers on GPT, AIGC, and LLM in the security domain, including but not limited to topics such as software supply chain security and threat detection.
- **Blog Articles:** Compile and share practical experiences and insights from experts and researchers using GPT, AIGC, and LLM in the security field, including case studies, technical evaluations, and application prospects.
- **Practical Tools:** Provide open-source tools, plugins, libraries, and other resources for GPT, AIGC, and LLM in the security field to facilitate practical operations for developers and researchers.
- **Preset Prompts:** Organize and share preset prompts suitable for GPT, AIGC, and LLM to conduct more effective training, inference, and testing in the security domain.

### 2. Maintain High-Quality Content

We highly value the quality of contributed content. Please ensure that your submission has the following characteristics:

- **Accuracy:** Information and data should be accurate and follow best practices and industry standards.
- **Readability:** Articles and descriptions should be clear and logical, avoiding overly complex terms and abbreviations.

### 3. Contribution Submission Process

At GPTSecurity, we encourage community members to submit contributions in various ways to accommodate different skills and needs. Here are three different contribution submission processes for you to choose from:

- **Submit via GitHub Issues:** Contributors can initiate submissions through GitHub New Issues. Indicate "GPTSecurity Contribution" and the category (such as "Paper," "Article," "Tool," or "Prompt") and the title of the manuscript in the title. In the comment, provide author information (if there are multiple authors, list all authors and their contact information), the source address of the manuscript, an introduction to the manuscript, and its value to the GPTSecurity community. If there are related links or extended resources, please provide them as well. After submitting the issue, we will respond to you as soon as possible to confirm receipt or provide suggestions for supplementing the manuscript.
- **Submit via GitHub Pull Requests (PR):** Contributors can initiate resource merge requests through GitHub PR. Please provide a title and description for your Pull Request, detailing the changes you are submitting. After submitting the Pull Request, we will respond as soon as possible to confirm acceptance or provide additional relevant suggestions.
- **Submit via GitBook:** We will invite core contributors to join our GitBook repository and directly maintain the knowledge base from the backend. If you are interested, please first participate in contributions through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests. We will invite you to join the GitBook repository based on your contributions.
